### Team Breakdown of work done

Robert - correct format for CSS/HTML spacing.  Javascript and CSS for navbar and getting the layout to look correct and pleasing to the eye.  Overall desing of the website once taken from Tom's inital layout.

Blaise - formatting correct input to API to get calls and objects to pull back all the different API's.

Tom - worked on materialize, first draft of the entire layout.  He also fixed a lot of the stuff we messed up on.  He was the definition of “ask your co-worker”.
Created the awesome logo!

## Troubles 

Robert - making the website look dynamic and pleasing to the eye.  Lots of work went into correct colors, lines, divison of spaces.  The navbar and how its sticky and moves in size when you move down the page.

Blaise - all the API calls.  He had to find a few different API's even after he had started on some.  The weather one was the hardest but he was able to adjust it to fix in each box and send the right time and weather.

Tom - getting everything just right.  Tom helped everybody in the team with all the little things that they needed.  He also designed the travel part of the website.  That was his hardest part.
